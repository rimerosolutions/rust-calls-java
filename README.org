#README rust-calls-java

* What is this?

** Overview

This is a very simple example of how a native [[https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html][Java]] library can be created and called from [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] programs.

** Minimal use-cases

- As Rust is relatively new in comparison to Java, there might be mature libraries that can be reused "almost as is"
- If you're more comfortable with Java (just like me), you might code few parts of your Rust application in Java (as needed).
  - I don't know Rust that well and there are programs that would literally take me few hours in Java (vs. few days in Rust)
  - There are several mature Java libraries with no direct equivalent in Rust, that I'd rather not write myself from scratch.

* How do I run this?

TL;DR

#+begin_src sh
  podman build -t localhost/rust-calls-java .
  podman image prune --filter label=stage=rust-calls-java-builder
  podman run localhost/rust-calls-java
#+end_src

** Option 1 - From Docker or Podman
You'll need to have either [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] or [[https://podman.io/][Podman]] installed first. I'll use =podman= as this is what I have installed, but it's literally the same syntax for =docker=.

*** Build the container image

At the root of this repository, run the following command.

#+begin_src sh
podman build -t localhost/rust-calls-java .
#+end_src

*** Run the rust executable from the container image

#+begin_src sh
podman run localhost/rust-calls-java
#+end_src

** Option 2 - From your local machine

Follow the instructions available in the projects in this git repository:
- First, build the =java-lib= project
- Then, you should be able to build and run the =rust-app= project
