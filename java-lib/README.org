#+TITLE: java-lib README

* What is this?

This is a simple Java native library, the /helloworld/ example.

The goal is to demonstrate how the /most trivial Java code/ that can be leveraged from another programming language such as Rust (=rust-app= project in this Git repository).

* What is required?

- [[https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases/tag/vm-21.3.0][GraalVM]] in order to generate the native library from Java code (=graalvm-ce-java11-linux-amd64-21.3.0.tar.gz= for Linux amd64).
- [[https://gradle.org][Gradle]] (optionally) for building the project: it can be auto-installed (Gradle wrapper)
- [[https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/llvm/Compiling/][LLVM]] and other libraries (zlib, ar, etc.)

* How to build?

This is a standard Gradle project but it does require =JAVA_HOME= and =GRAALVM_HOME= to be set to your =GRAALVM= installation folder.
- If you have an existing gradle installation, please run =gradle nativeBuild=.
- Otherwise, please invoke the gradle wrapper as follow =./gradlew nativeBuild=.

The artifacts will be generate under =build/native/nativeBuild= (C header files and library).
